To install the Ubuntu Subsystem on Windows 10 without using the Microsoft Store, you can follow these steps. This approach involves manually enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) feature and downloading the Ubuntu distribution directly.

### Step 1: Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Right-click on the Start menu and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".
   
2. **Enable WSL:**
   - Run the following command to enable WSL:

     ```bash
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
     ```

3. **Enable Virtual Machine Platform (for WSL 2):**
   - To install WSL 2, you'll also need to enable the Virtual Machine Platform:

     ```bash
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
     ```

4. **Restart your computer:**
   - After enabling these features, restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Step 2: Download and Install a Linux Distro (e.g., Ubuntu)
1. **Download the Ubuntu distribution:**
   - You can download the Ubuntu app package directly from the official releases page:
     - Go to the [Ubuntu WSL release page on GitHub](https://github.com/ubuntu/WSL/releases).
     - Download the `.appx` package for the version of Ubuntu you want to install.

2. **Install the Ubuntu distribution:**
   - Once the `.appx` package is downloaded, you can install it using PowerShell.
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator, then navigate to the directory where the `.appx` file was downloaded and run:

     ```bash
     Add-AppxPackage .\Ubuntu_XXXX.xxxx.appx
     ```

   - Replace `Ubuntu_XXXX.xxxx.appx` with the exact name of the downloaded file.

### Step 3: Set WSL 2 as Default (Optional)
- If you want to use WSL 2 as the default version, run the following command in PowerShell:

  ```bash
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```

### Step 4: Launch Ubuntu
- You can now find Ubuntu in your Start menu. Click on it to launch the terminal, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation and set up your Ubuntu user account.

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, make sure your Windows 10 is updated to at least version 1903 and build 18362 or higher.
  
By following these steps, you can install Ubuntu on your Windows 10 system without using the Microsoft Store.
