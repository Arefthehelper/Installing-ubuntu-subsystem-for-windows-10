while running ubuntu wsl you might run into some permission errors
just like me but there are some solutions that is found,
here there are.
The permission error you're encountering when running `buildozer -v android debug` on Ubuntu WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a common issue due to the way WSL interacts with the file system, particularly when dealing with file permissions. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

### 1. **Check and Set Permissions**
   
   Ensure that the necessary files, particularly the `main.py` and any other files or directories in your project, have the correct permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   chmod -R 755 .
   ```

   The `755` permission allows the owner to read, write, and execute, and others to read and execute the files and directories. 

   If the error is related to `adb` or other executables, make sure they are executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x path/to/adb
   ```

### 2. **Run as Root (if necessary)**

   If you're still encountering permission errors, you can try running `buildozer` with `sudo`:

   ```bash
   sudo buildozer -v android debug
   ```

   However, this is generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary, as it can lead to other permission-related issues.

### 3. **Adjusting WSL File Permissions**

   Sometimes WSL can inherit file permissions from Windows, which might not be fully compatible with Linux commands. You can try mounting the file system with modified permissions:

   Edit the `/etc/wsl.conf` file (create it if it doesn't exist):

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
   ```

   Add the following:

   ```ini
   [automount]
   options = "metadata,umask=22,fmask=11"
   ```

   This will adjust the default permissions when WSL mounts the file system.

   After editing, restart WSL:

   ```bash
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

   Then, reopen your WSL terminal.

### 4. **Check for Conflicting Processes**

   Sometimes, there could be conflicting processes or locked files that cause permission issues. Ensure that no other process is using the files or directories youâ€™re working with.

### 5. **Ensure ADB is Running**

   Make sure that `adb` is running with appropriate permissions. Sometimes the error may not be directly related to Buildozer but to the interaction with `adb`. You can start `adb` manually with:

   ```bash
   adb start-server
   ```

   If `adb` is in a non-standard location, make sure its path is correctly set in your environment variables or Buildozer spec file.

### 6. **Switch to Ubuntu Terminal**

   If the problem persists, consider trying to run the Buildozer command from a full Ubuntu terminal, either in a virtual machine or dual-boot, instead of WSL. This can sometimes resolve persistent permission issues caused by the WSL environment.

### 7. **Use a Virtual Environment**

   It's a good practice to use a Python virtual environment to isolate your dependencies and permissions. If you aren't already doing this, you might want to try setting up a virtual environment for your project:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   Then, install the necessary dependencies and try running Buildozer again.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission error and successfully run `buildozer -v android debug`. If the issue persists, the specific error message you're encountering would provide further clues for troubleshooting.
